                <h2>Buying Guide for Air Fryers</h2>
                <h3>1. Capacity</h3>
                <p>Consider the size of your household and the amount of food you typically cook. Air fryers come in various capacities, ranging from 2L to 6L and more. For individuals or couples, a smaller capacity (2-3L) should suffice, while families might benefit from a larger model (4-6L).</p>

                <h3>2. Power</h3>
                <p>The power of an air fryer is measured in watts. Higher wattage generally means faster cooking times. Most air fryers range from 1000W to 1800W. Choose a model with higher wattage if you want quicker results.</p>

                <h3>3. Features</h3>
                <p>Modern air fryers come with a variety of features such as preset programs, digital touch screens, and additional cooking functions like baking, roasting, and dehydrating. Decide which features are important to you based on your cooking needs.</p>

                <h3>4. Ease of Use</h3>
                <p>Look for air fryers with user-friendly controls and clear instructions. Digital touch screens and preset programs can make cooking easier, especially for beginners.</p>

                <h3>5. Cleaning</h3>
                <p>Check if the air fryer's components are dishwasher-safe. Models with non-stick surfaces and removable parts are easier to clean and maintain.</p>

                <h3>6. Safety Features</h3>
                <p>Safety features like cool-touch handles and overheat protection are important, especially in households with children. Ensure the air fryer you choose has these safety measures.</p>

                <h3>7. Price</h3>
                <p>Air fryers are available at various price points. Set a budget and look for a model that offers the best value for your money. Remember that higher-priced models often come with more features and larger capacities.</p>
